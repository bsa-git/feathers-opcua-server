# Introduction.

The application **FEATHERS-OPCUA-SERVER** is designed to implement the use of the library
[NodeOPCUA](https://node-opcua.github.io/) .  

**NodeOPCUA** is a [OPC UA](https://opcfoundation.org/faq/what-is-opc-ua/) stack fully written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/). Basic properties:

* **NodeOPCUA** takes advantage of the asynchronous nature of node.js, creating highly responsive applications.
* **NodeOPCUA** has been developed using [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Driven_Development) and benefits from more than 2500 unit tests and 90% code coverage.
* **NodeOPCUA** can be use in Javascript as well as in Typescript.
* **NodeOPCUA** is free for commercial use. Check out the [license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-opcua/node-opcua/master/LICENSE).
* **NodeOPCUA** is available on GitHub . Check out the [source code](https://github.com/node-opcua/node-opcua).
* **NodeOPCUA** runs on all the platforms that nodeJS supports.
* **NodeOPCUA** will benefit from a [comprehensive SDK API documentation](https://node-opcua.github.io/api_doc/index.html), numerous end-to-end functional tests, and a set of practical examples to help you learn how to use it.

## Why do you need a framework [FeathersJS](https://docs.feathersjs.com/).

Servers and clients created on the basis of the library **NodeOPCUA** are built into **FeathersJS** and are services of this framework. This makes it possible to store the data received by the protocol **OPC UA** in different databases. And also have access to **OPC UA** data through **REST API**.
